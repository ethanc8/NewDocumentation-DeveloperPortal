# Platform Components

This part of the GNUstep platform introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the libraries and services that are provided by the GNUstep project, and which provide the primary basis for creating apps using the GNUstep platform.

{doc}`GNUstep libraries <overview/libraries>` include things like GNUstep GUI, for building application user interfaces and GNUstep Base, for standard library and networking.

{doc}`GNUstep services <overview/services>` are included in the system and give apps access to things like email, calendaring, contacts, and password storage.
<!-- One of the most useful services for apps is portals, which provides sandboxed
apps with access to a wide range of system features. -->
