# Tools

When developing applications and system components for GNOME, you'll likely need
to rely on various tools outside of your editor.

- {doc}`GTK Inspector <tools/inspector>`: inspect GTK applications
- {doc}`Valgrind <tools/valgrind>`: a tool that allows to track memory related
  errors in C and C++ programs
- {doc}`Massif <tools/massif>`: a heap profiler, part of the Valgrind suite
- {doc}`Sysprof <tools/sysprof>`: a system-wide sampling profiler that uses the
  perf Linux kernel module
