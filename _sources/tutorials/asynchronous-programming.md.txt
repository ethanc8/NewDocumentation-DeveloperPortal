# Asynchronous Programming

## Summary

- Use asynchronous calls in preference to synchronous calls or explicit use of
  threads
- Learn and follow the GLib pattern for declaring asynchronous APIs
- Place callbacks from asynchronous functions in order down the file, so control
  flow is easy to follow
- Use the presence of a `GTask` or `GCancellable` to indicate whether an
  operation is ongoing
- If running operations in parallel, track how many operations are yet to start,
  and how many are yet to finish — the overall operation is complete once both
  counts are zero
- Separate state for operations into ‘task data’ structures for `GTask`,
  allowing operations to be reused more easily without needing changes to
  global state handling
- Consider how asynchronous methods on an object instance interact with
  finalization of that instance

## Concepts

GLib supports *asynchronous programming*, where long-running operations can be
started, run ‘in the background’, and a callback invoked when they are finished
and their results are available. This is in direct contrast to synchronous
long-running operations, which are a single function call which blocks program
control flow until complete.

As discussed in the {doc}`Main Contexts </tutorials/main-contexts>` and in the
{doc}`Threading </tutorials/threading>` tutorials, asynchronous operations
should be favoured over synchronous ones and over explicit use of threading.
They do not block the main context like sychronous operations do; and are
easier to use correctly than threads. They often also have a lower performance
penalty than spawning a thread and sending work to it.

## API patterns

Asynchronous calls follow a standard pattern in GLib code. For an operation
named `load_data` on the `File` class in the `Foo` namespace, there will
be:

```{eval-rst}
.. tabs::

   .. tab:: C

      .. code-block:: c

         void
         foo_file_load_data_async (FooFile             *self,
                                   // ...,
                                   GCancellable        *cancellable,
                                   GAsyncReadyCallback  callback,
                                   gpointer             user_data);

         gboolean
         foo_file_load_data_finish (FooFile       *self,
                                    GAsyncResult  *result,
                                    // ...,
                                    GError       **error);


      The ``…`` parameters to ``foo_file_load_data_async()`` are those specific to the
      operation—in this case, perhaps the size of a buffer to load into. Similarly for
      ``foo_file_load_data_finish()`` they are the operation-specific return
      values—perhaps a location to return a content type string in this case.

      When ``foo_file_load_data_async()`` is called, it schedules the load operation
      in the background (as a new file descriptor on the ``GMainContext`` or as a
      worker thread, for example), then returns without blocking.

      When the operation is complete, the callback is executed in the same
      ``GMainContext`` as the original asynchronous call. The callback is invoked
      exactly once, whether the operation succeeded or failed.

      From the callback, ``foo_file_load_data_finish()`` may be called by the user’s
      code to retrieve return values and error details, passing the ``GAsyncResult``
      instance which was passed to the callback.


   .. tab:: Python

      .. code-block:: python

         Foo.File.load_data_async(self,
                                  # *additional_arguments,
                                  cancellable: Gio.Cancellable,
                                  callback:    GAsyncReadyCallback,
                                  user_data) -> None

         Foo.File.load_data_finish(self,
                                   result: Gio.AsyncResult
                                   ) -> bool #, *additional_return_values


      The ``*additional_arguments`` parameters to ``Foo.File.load_data_async()`` are
      those specific to the operation—in this case, perhaps the size of a buffer to
      load into. Similarly ``*additional_return_values`` for ``Foo.File.load_data_finish()``
      are the operation-specific return values—perhaps a content type string in this case.

      ``callback`` is a callable (e.g. a function) that will be called with three parameters
      when the operation has been completed. Those parameters are:

      - The ``Foo.File`` instance whose ``load_data_async()`` method we called
      - A ``Gio.AsyncResult``
      - user_data

      When ``Foo.File.load_data_async()`` is called, it schedules the load operation
      in the background (as a new file descriptor on the ``GLib.MainContext`` or as a
      worker thread, for example), then returns without blocking.

      When the operation is complete, the callback is executed in the same
      ``GLib.MainContext`` as the original asynchronous call. The callback is invoked
      exactly once, whether the operation succeeded or failed.

      From the callback, ``Foo.File.load_data_finish()`` may be called by the user’s
      code to retrieve return values and error details, passing the ``Gio.AsyncResult``
      instance which was passed to the callback.

```

## Operation Lifetimes

When writing asynchronous operations, it is common to write them as methods of a
class. In this case, it is important to define how ongoing operations on a class
instance interact with finalization of that instance. There are two approaches:

**Strong**

: The ongoing operation keeps a reference to the class instance, forcing it to
  remain alive for the duration of the operation. The class should provide some
  kind of ‘close’ or ‘cancel’ method which can be used by other classes to force
  cancellation of the operation and allow that instance to be finalized.

**Weak**

: The ongoing operation does *not* keep a reference to the class instance, and
  the class cancels the operation (using `g_cancellable_cancel()`) in its
  dispose function.

Which approach is used depends on the class’ design. A class which wraps a
particular operation (perhaps a `MyFileTransfer` class, for example) might
want to use the *weak* approach. A class which manages multiple network
connections and asynchronous operations on them may use the *strong* approach
instead. Due to incoming network connections, for example, it might not be in
complete control of the scheduling of its asynchronous calls, so the weak
approach would not be appropriate—any code dropping a reference to the object
could not be sure it was not accidentally killing a new network connection.

## Using asynchronous functions

It is often the case that multiple asynchronous calls need to be used to
complete an operation. For example, opening a file for reading, then performing
a couple of reads, and then closing the file. Or opening several network sockets
in parallel and waiting until they are all open before continuing with other
work. Some examples of these situations are given below.

### Single operation

A single asynchronous call requires two functions: one to start the operation,
and one to complete it. In C, the demanding part of performing an asynchronous
call is correctly storing state between these two functions, and handling
changes to that state in the time between those two functions being called. For
example, cancellation of an ongoing asynchronous call is a state change, and if
not implemented carefully, any UI updates (for example) made when cancelling an
operation will be undone by updates in the operation’s callback.

The example below demonstrates copying a file from one location in the file
system to another. The key principles demonstrated here are:

- Placing the `copy_button_clicked_cb()` (start) and `copy_finish_cb()`
  (finish) functions in order by using a forward declaration for
  `copy_finish_cb()`. This means the control flow continues linearly down the
  file, rather than getting to the bottom of `copy_button_clicked_cb()` and
  resuming in `copy_finish_cb()` somewhere else in the file.
- Using a `GCancellable` to allow cancelling the operation after it has
  started. The code in `cancel_button_clicked_cb()` is very simple: as the
  `copy_finish_cb()` callback is guaranteed to be invoked when the operation
  completes (even when completing early due to cancellation), all the UI and
  state updates for cancellation can be handled there, rather than in
  `cancel_button_clicked_cb()`.
- An operation is ongoing exactly while `MyObjectPrivate.copy_cancellable` is
  not `NULL`, making it easy to track running operations. Note that this
  means only one file copy operation can be started via
  `copy_button_clicked_cb()` at a time. One `GCancellable` cannot easily be
  used for multiple operations like this.

For comparison, here is the same code implemented using the synchronous version
of `g_file_copy()`. Note how the order of statements is almost identical.  The
UI is blocked from updating and receiving user input, which also means that
cancellation cannot be supported. This is the main reason why this code should
not be used in practice:

### Operations in series

A common situation is to run multiple asynchronous operations in series, when
each operation depends on the previous one completing.

In this example, the application reads a socket address from a file, opens a
connection to that address, reads a message, and then finishes.

Key points in this example are:

- Each callback is numbered consistently, and they are all placed in order in
  the file so the code follows sequentially.
- As in the single-call example, a single `GCancellable` indicates that the
  series of operations is ongoing. Cancelling it aborts the entire sequence.
- As in the single-call example, the pending operation is cancelled if the
  owning `MyObject` instance is disposed, to prevent callbacks being called
  later with an invalid MyObject pointer.

### Operations in parallel

Another common situation is to run multiple asynchronous operations in parallel,
considering the overall operation complete when all its constituents are
complete.

In this example, the application deletes multiple files in parallel.

Key points in this example are:

- The number of pending asynchronous operations (ones which have started but not
  yet finished) is tracked as `n_deletions_pending`. The `delete_files_cb()`
  callback only considers the entire operation complete once this reaches zero.
- `n_deletions_to_start` tracks deletion operations being started, in case
  `g_file_delete_async()` manages to use a fast path and complete
  synchronously (without blocking).
- As in the single-call example, all pending deletions are cancelled if the
  owning `MyObject` instance is disposed, to prevent callbacks being called
  later with an invalid `MyObject` pointer.

### Wrapping with GTask

Often when an asynchronous operation (or set of operations) becomes more
complex, it needs associated state. This is typically stored in a custom
structure — but defining a new structure to store the standard callback, user
data and cancellable tuple is laborious. `GTask` eases this by providing a
standardized way to wrap all three, plus extra custom ‘task data’.

The use of a `GTask` can replace the use of a `GCancellable` for
indicating whether an operation is ongoing.

This example is functionally the same as the operations in series example,
but refactored to use a `GTask` to wrap the sequence of operations.

Key points in this example are:

- State which was in `MyObjectPrivate` in the series example is now in the
  `ConnectToServerData` closure, which is set as the ‘task data’ of the
  `GTask` representing the overall operation. This means it’s automatically
  freed after the operation returns.
- Furthermore, this means that manipulations of `MyObjectPrivate` state are
  limited to the start and end of the sequence of operations, so reusing the
  task in different situations becomes possible—for example, it is now a lot
  easier to support running multiple such tasks in parallel.
- As the `GTask` holds a reference to `MyObject`, it is impossible for the
  object to be disposed while the sequence of operations is ongoing, so the
  `my_object_dispose()` code has been removed. Instead, a
  `my_object_close()` method exists to allow any pending operations can be
  cancelled so `MyObject` can be disposed when desired.
