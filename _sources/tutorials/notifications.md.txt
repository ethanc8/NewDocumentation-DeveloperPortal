# Using Notifications

GNOME applications should use notifications to inform the user that something
has happened that requires their attention.

Notifications should not be intrusive, or distracting.

For more information on when to use notifications, you should follow the [Human
Interface Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/patterns/feedback/notifications.html).

Remember that users can disable notifications for specific applications, or
globally. You should not rely exclusively on notifications.

## Prerequisites

In order to use notifications in GNOME you will need to:

- use `GApplication` or `GtkApplication`
- provide a valid desktop file with the same name as your [application id](application-id)
- ensure that your application can be activated via D-Bus

The desktop file and D-Bus activation provide notification persistence, allowing
the desktop to associate the notification to the application even if the
application is not running.

## Anatomy of a notification

A typical notification has a number of ingredients:

- a one-line **title**
- a longer, descriptive **message body** (optional)
- an **icon** (optional)
- **actions**, each with a label for use in a button (optional)
- additionally, notifications may be marked as **urgent**

## Creating a notification

To send a notification, first create a `GNotification` object, and add the
data for your notification to it:

```{eval-rst}
.. tabs::

   .. code-tab:: c

        g_autoptr(GNotification) notification = g_notification_new ("Lunch is ready");

        g_notification_set_body (notification, "Today we have pancakes and salad, and fruit and cake for dessert");

        g_autoptr(GFile) file = g_file_new_for_path ("fruitbowl.png");
        g_autoptr(GFileIcon) icon = g_file_icon_new (file);

        // The notification instance will acquire a reference on the icon
        g_notification_set_icon (notification, G_ICON (icon));

   .. code-tab:: python

      notification = Gio.Notification()
      notification.set_title("Lunch is ready")
      notification.set_body("Today we have pancakes and salad, and fruit and cake for dessert")

      file = Gio.File.new_for_path("fruitbowl.png")
      icon = Gio.FileIcon(file=file)

      notification.set_icon(icon)

   .. code-tab:: vala

      var notification = new Notification ("Lunch is ready");

      notification.set_body ("Today we have pancakes and salad, and fruit and cake for dessert");

      var file = new File.for_path ("fruitbowl.png");

      var icon = new FileIcon (file);

      // The notification instance will acquire a reference on the icon
      notification.set_icon (icon);

   .. code-tab:: js

      const notification = new Gio.Notification();

      notification.set_title("Lunch is ready");
      notification.set_body(
        "Today we have pancakes and salad, and fruit and cake for dessert",
      );

      const file = Gio.File.new_for_path("fruitbowl.png");

      const icon = new Gio.FileIcon({file});

      // The notification instance will acquire a reference on the icon
      notification.set_icon(icon);
```

Note that the title should be short; the body can be longer, say a paragraph.
The icon may be displayed at a small size (say, 24Ã—24), so choose an icon that
is remains readable at small size.

To show your notification to the user, use the `GApplication` function for this
purpose:

```{eval-rst}
.. tabs::
   .. code-tab:: c

      // The application instance will acquire a reference on the
      // notification object
      g_application_send_notification (application, "lunch-is-ready", notification);

   .. code-tab:: python

      # The Application instance will acquire a reference on the
      # notification object
      application.send_notification("lunch-is-ready", notification)

   .. code-tab:: vala

      // The application instance will acquire a reference on the
      // notification object
      application.send_notification ("lunch-is-ready", notification);

   .. code-tab:: js

      // The application instance will acquire a reference on the
      // notification object
      application.send_notification("lunch-is-ready", notification);
```

You need to provide an id for your notification here. This can be used if you
want to make updates to an existing notification: simply send a notification
with the same id. Note that the GNotification object does not have to be kept
around after sending the notification; you can unref it right away. It is not a
'live' object that is associated with the visible notification.

## Adding actions

Often, you want the user to be able to react to the notification in some way,
other than just dismissing it. `GNotification` lets you do this by associating
actions with your notification. These will typically be presented as buttons in
the popup. One action has a special role, it is the 'default' action that gets
activated when the user clicks on the notification, not on a particular button.

```{eval-rst}
.. tabs::
   .. code-tab:: c

      g_notification_set_default_action (notification, "app.go-to-lunch");
      g_notification_add_button (notification, "5 minutes", "app.reply-5-minutes");
      g_notification_add_button (notification, "Order takeout", "app.order-takeout");

   .. code-tab:: python

      notification.set_default_action("app.go-to-lunch")
      notification.add_button("5 minutes", "app.reply-5-minutes")
      notification.add_button("Order takeout", "app.order-takeout")

   .. code-tab:: vala

      notification.set_default_action ("app.go-to-lunch");
      notification.add_button ("5 minutes", "app.reply-5-minutes");
      notification.add_button ("Order takeout", "app.order-takeout");

   .. code-tab:: js

      notification.set_default_action("app.go-to-lunch");
      notification.add_button("5 minutes", "app.reply-5-minutes");
      notification.add_button("Order takeout", "app.order-takeout");
```

The actions are referred to here with their 'app.' prefixed name. This indicates
that the actions have to be added to your `GApplication`. You can not use any
other actions in `GNotifications` (window-specific actions with a 'win.' prefix,
or key shorcuts using other prefixes will not work).

## Actions with parameters

A common pattern is to pass a 'target' parameter to the action that contains
sufficient details about the notification to let your application react in a
meaningful way.

As an example, here is how a notification about a newly installed application
could provide a launch button:

```{eval-rst}
.. tabs::
   .. code-tab:: c

      g_autofree char *title = g_strdup_printf ("%s is now installed", appname);
      g_autoptr(GNotification) notification = g_notification_new (title);

      g_notification_add_button_with_target (notification, "Launch", "app.launch", "s", appid);

      g_application_send_notification (application, "app-installed", notification);

   .. code-tab:: python

      notification = Gio.Notification()
      notification.set_title(f"{appname} is now installed")

      notification.add_button_with_target("Launch", "app.launch", "s", appid)

      application.send_notification("app-installed", notification)

   .. code-tab:: vala

      string title = appname + " is now installed";
      var notification = new Notification (title);

      notification.add_button_with_target ("Launch", "app.launch", "s", appid);

      application.send_notification ("app-installed", notification);

   .. code-tab:: js

      const title = appname + " is now installed";
      const notification = new Gio.Notification();
      notification.set_title(title);

      notification.add_button_with_target(
        "Launch",
        "app.launch",
        GLib.Variant.new_string(appid),
      );

      application.send_notification("app-installed", notification);
```

To make this work, your application needs to have a suitable 'launch' action
that takes the application id as a string parameter:

```{eval-rst}
.. tabs::
   .. code-tab:: c

      static GActionEntry actions[] = {
        { "launch", launch_application, "s", NULL, NULL },
          // ...
      };

      g_action_map_add_action_entries (G_ACTION_MAP (application),
                                       actions, G_N_ELEMENTS (actions),
                                       application);

   .. code-tab:: python

      # The "launch_application" function is defined elsewhere
      action = Gio.SimpleAction(name="launch")
      action.connect("activate", launch_application)
      application.add_action(action)

   .. code-tab:: vala

      // the "launch_application" function is defined elsewhere
      ActionEntry actions[] = {
        { "launch", launch_application },
        // ...
      };

      application.add_action_entries (actions, application);

   .. code-tab:: js

      // the "launch_application" function is defined elsewhere
      const action = new Gio.SimpleAction({ name: "launch" });
      action.connect("activate", launch_application);
      application.add_action(action);

```

## Stale notifications

Sometimes, a notification is no longer relevant and should not persist any
longer. In those cases, you can explicitly withdraw it, like this:

```{eval-rst}
.. tabs::
   .. code-tab:: c

      if (now_is_tea_time ())
        g_application_withdraw_notification (application, "lunch-is-ready");

   .. code-tab:: python

      if now_is_tea_time():
          application.withdraw_notification("lunch-is-ready")

   .. code-tab:: vala

      if (now_is_tea_time ())
        application.withdraw_notification ("lunch-is-ready");

   .. code-tab:: js

      if (now_is_tea_time()) {
         application.withdraw_notification("lunch-is-ready");
      }
```

## Disabling notifications

If your application uses notifications, you should allow users to disable them.

GNOME has a blanket "do not disturb" mode, but each application can be
individually controlled through the "Notifications" settings panel.

In order to make your application appear in the panel, add the following line to
your desktop file:

```
X-GNOME-UsesNotifications=true
```
