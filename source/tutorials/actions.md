# Actions

A `GAction` is a representation of a single user-interesting action in an application.

To use `GAction` you should be using {doc}`GtkApplication <application>`.

:::{note}
It's possible to use `GAction` without `GtkApplication` but this is not
discussed here.
:::

## What it is, what it isn't

A `GAction` is essentially a way to tell the toolkit about a piece of
functionality in your program, and to give it a name.

Actions are purely functional. They do not contain any presentational information.

An action has four pieces of information associated with it:

- a **name** as an identifier (usually all-lowercase, untranslated English string)
- an **enabled** flag indicating if the action can be activated or not (like "sensitive")
- an optional **state** value, for stateful actions (like a boolean for toggles)
- an optional **parameter** type, used when activating the action

An action supports two operations:

- activation, invoked with an optional parameter (of the correct type, see
  above)
- state change request, invoked with a new requested state value (of the
  correct type). Only supported for stateful actions.

Here are some rules about an action:

- the **name** is immutable (in the sense that it will never change) and it
  is never `NULL`

- the **enabled** flag can change

- the **parameter** type is immutable

- the **parameter type** is optional: it can be `NULL`

  - if the parameter type is `NULL` then action activation must be done
    without a parameter (ie: a `NULL` GVariant pointer)
  - if the parameter type is non `NULL` then the parameter must have this
    type

- the **state** can change, but it cannot change type

  - if the action was stateful when it was created, it will always have a
    state and it will always have exactly the same type (such as boolean
    or string)
  - if the action was stateless when it was created, it can never have a state

- you can only request **state changes** on stateful actions and it is only
  possible to request that the state change to a value of the same type as the
  existing state

An action does **not** have any of the following:

- a label
- an icon
- a way of creating a widget corresponding to it
- any other sort of presentational information

## Action state and parameters

Most actions in your application will be stateless actions with no parameters.
These typically appear as menu items with no special decoration. An example is
"quit".

Stateful actions are used to represent an action which has a closely-associated
state of some kind. A good example is a "fullscreen" action. For this case,
you'd expect to see a checkmark next to the menu item when the fullscreen option
is active. This is usually called a toggle action, and it has a boolean state.
By convention, toggle actions have no parameter type for activation: activating
the action always toggles the state.

Another common case is to have an action representing a enumeration of possible
values of a given type (typically string). This is often called a radio action
and is usually represented in the user interface with radio buttons or radio
menu items, or sometimes a combobox. A good example is "text-justify" with
possible values "left", "center", and "right". By convention, these types of
actions have a parameter type equal to their state type, and activating them
with a particular parameter value is equivalent to changing their state to that
value.

:::{note}
This approach to handling radio buttons is different than many other action
systems. With `GAction`, there is only one action for "text-justify" and
"left", "center" and "right" are possible states on that action. There are
not three separate "justify-left", "justify-center" and "justify-right"
actions.
:::

The final common type of action is a stateless action with a parameter. This is
typically used for actions like "open-bookmark" where the parameter to the
action would be the identifier of the bookmark to open.

## Action target and detailed names

Because some types of actions cannot be invoked without a parameter, it is often
important to specify a parameter when referring to the action from a place where
it will be invoked (such as from a radio button that sets the state to a
particular value or from a menu item that opens a specific bookmark). From these
contexts, the value used for the action parameter is typically called the target
of the action.

Even though toggle actions have a state, they do not have a parameter.
Therefore, a target value is not needed when referring to them -- they will
always be toggled on activation.

Most APIs that allow using a `GAction` (such as `GMenuModel` and
`GtkActionable`) allow use of detailed action names. This is a convenient way
of specifying an action name and an action target with a single string.

In the case that the action target is a string with no unusual characters (ie:
only alpha-numeric, plus '-' and '.') then you can use a detailed action name of
the form `justify::left` to specify the justify action with a target of left.

In the case that the action target is not a string, or contains unusual
characters, you can use the more general format `action-name(5)`, where the "5"
here is any valid text-format `GVariant` (ie: a string that can be parsed by
`g_variant_parse()`). Another example is `open-bookmark('http://gnome.org/')`.

You can convert between detailed action names and split-out action names and
target values using `g_action_parse_detailed_action_name()` and
`g_action_print_detailed_action_name()` but usually you will not need to. Most
APIs will provide both ways of specifying actions with targets.

## Action scopes

Actions are always scoped to a particular object on which they operate.

GTK allows you to create any number of scopes for actions, but will always have
two predefined scopes available:

- `app`, for actions global to the application
- `win`, for actions tied to an application window

Actions scoped to windows should be the actions that specifically impact that
window. These are actions like "fullscreen" and "close", or in the case that a
window contains a document, "save" and "print".

Actions that impact the application as a whole rather than one specific window
are scoped to the application. These are actions like "about" and "preferences".

If a particular action is scoped to a window then it is scoped to a specific
window. Another way of saying this: if your application has a "fullscreen"
action that applies to windows and it has three windows, then it will have three
fullscreen actions: one for each window.

Having a separate action per-window allows for each window to have a separate
state for each instance of the action as well as being able to control the
enabled state of the action on a per-window basis.

Actions are added to their relevant scope (application or window) using the
`GActionMap` interface.

## `GActionMap`

`GActionMap` is an interface exposing a mapping of action names to actions. It
is implemented by `GtkApplication` and `GtkApplicationWindow`. Actions can
be added, removed, or looked up.

```{eval-rst}
.. tabs::
   .. code-tab:: c

      void      g_action_map_add_action    (GActionMap  *action_map,
                                            GAction     *action);
      void      g_action_map_remove_action (GActionMap  *action_map,
                                            const gchar *action_name);
      GAction * g_action_map_lookup_action (GActionMap  *action_map,
                                            const gchar *action_name);

   .. code-tab:: python

      class ActionMap:
          def add_action(self, action: Gio.Action):
              pass

          def remove_action(self, action_name: str):
              pass

          def lookup_action(self, action_name: str) -> Gio.Action:
              pass

   .. code-tab:: vala

      public interface ActionMap {
          public void add_action (GLib.Action action);

          public void remove_action (string action_name);

          public GLib.Action lookup_action (string action_name);
      }

   .. code-tab:: js

      action_map.add_action(action); // GLib.Action
      action_map.remove_action(action_name); // string
      action_map.lookup_action(action_name); // string
```

If you want to insert several actions at the same time, it is typically faster
and easier to use `GActionEntry`.

When referring to actions on a `GActionMap` only the name of the action itself
is used (ie: "quit", not "app.quit"). The "app.quit" form is only used when
referring to actions from places like a `GMenu` or `GtkActionable` widget
where the scope of the action is not already known. Because you're using the
`GtkApplication` or `GtkApplicationWindow` as the `GActionMap` it is clear
which object your action is scoped to, so the prefix is not needed.

## `GSimpleAction` vs `GAction`

`GAction` is an interface with several implementations. The one that you are
most likely to use directly is `GSimpleAction`.

A good way to think about the split between `GAction` and `GSimpleAction` is
that `GAction` is the "consumer interface" and `GSimpleAction` is the
"provider interface". The `GAction` interface provides the functions that are
consumed by users/callers/displayers of the action (such as menus and widgets).
The `GSimpleAction` interface is only accessed by the code that provides the
implementation for the action itself.

Note that `GActionMap` takes a `GAction`. Your action will only be
"consumed" as a result of you putting it in a `GActionMap`.

Compare:

- `GAction` has a function for checking if an action is enabled
  (`g_action_get_enabled()`) but only the `GSimpleAction` API can enable or
  disable an action (`g_simple_action_set_enabled()`).
- `GAction` has a function to query the state of the action
  (`g_action_get_state()`) and request changes to it
  (`g_action_change_state()`) but only `GSimpleAction` has the API to directly
  set the state value (`g_simple_action_set_state()`).

If you want to provide a custom `GAction` implementation then you can have
your own mechanism to control access to state setting and enabled. The GSettings
`GAction` implementation, for example, gets its state directly from the value
in GSettings and is enabled according to lockdown in effect on the key. It is
not possible to directly modify these values in any way (although it is possible
to indirectly affect the state by changing the value of the setting, if you have
permission to do so).

## Using `GSimpleAction`

If you are implementing actions, probably you will do it with `GSimpleAction`.

`GSimpleAction` has two interesting signals: `activate` and
`change-state`. These correspond directly to `g_action_activate()` and
`g_action_change_state()`. You will almost certainly need to connect a handler
to the activate signal in order to handle the action being activated. The signal
handler takes a GVariant parameter which is the parameter that was passed to
`g_action_activate()`.

If your action is stateful, you may also want to connect a change-state handler
to deal with state change requests. If your action is stateful and you do not
connect a handler for the change-state signal then the default is that all state
change requests will always change the state to the requested value. Even if you
always want the state to be set to the requested value, you will probably want
to connect a handler so that you can take some action in response to the state
being changed.

The default behaviour of setting the state in response to
`g_action_change_state()` is disabled when connecting a handler to
change-state.  You therefore need to be sure to call
`g_simple_action_set_state()` from your handler if you actually want the state
to change.

A convenient way to bulk-create all the `GSimpleActions` you need to add to a
`GActionMap` is to use a `GActionEntry` array and
`g_action_map_add_action_entries()`:

```{eval-rst}
.. tabs::
   .. code-tab:: c

      static GActionEntry app_entries[] = {
        { "preferences", preferences_activated, NULL, NULL, NULL },
        { "quit", quit_activated, NULL, NULL, NULL }
      };

      static void
      example_app_startup (GApplication *app)
      {
        // ...
        g_action_map_add_action_entries (G_ACTION_MAP (app),
                                      app_entries, G_N_ELEMENTS (app_entries),
                                      app);
        // ...
      }

   .. code-tab:: vala

      public class Example.App : GLib.Application {

          public override void startup () {
              // ...
              ActionEntry app_entries[] = {
                  { "preferences", this.preferences_activated },
                  { "quit", this.quit_activated }
              };
              this.add_action_entries (app_entries, this);
              // ...
          }

          private void preferences_activated (SimpleAction action, Variant? parameter) {
              // ...
          }

          private void quit_activated (SimpleAction action, Variant? parameter) {
              // ...
          }
      }

```

## Other kinds of actions

Besides `GSimpleAction`, GIO provides some other implementations of
`GAction`. One is `GSettingsAction`, which wraps a GSettings key with an
action that represents the value of the setting and lets you set the key to a
new value when activated. Another is `GPropertyAction`, which similarly
wraps a GObject property.

Both `GSettingsAction` and `GPropertyAction` implement toggle-on-activate
behaviour for boolean states - note that `GSimpleAction` does not, you have
to implement an activate handler yourself for that.

## Adding actions to your GtkApplication

You can add a `GAction` to anything implementing the `GActionMap` interface,
including `GtkApplication`. This is done with `g_action_map_add_action()`
and `g_action_map_add_action_entries()`.

Typically, you will want to do this during the startup phase of your
application.

It's possible to add or remove actions at any time, but doing it before startup
is wasteful in case the application is a remote instance (and will just exit
anyway). It is also possible to dynamically add and remove actions any time
after startup, when the application is running.

## Adding actions to your GtkApplicationWindow

`GtkApplicationWindow` also implements `GActionMap`. You will typically
want to add most actions to your window when it is constructed. It is possible
to add and remove actions at any time while the window exists.

For example:

```{eval-rst}
.. tabs::

   .. code-tab:: c

      static void
      on_save_activate (GAction *action,
                        GVariant *param)
      {
        g_print ("You are welcome");
      }

      static void
      on_app_activate (GApplication *app)
      {
        GtkWidget *window = gtk_application_window_new (GTK_APPLICATION (app));
        gtk_window_present (GTK_WINDOW (window));

        GAction *action = g_simple_action_new ("save", NULL);
        g_signal_connect (action, "activate", G_CALLBACK (on_save_activate), NULL);
        g_action_map_add_action (G_ACTION_MAP (window), action);

        GtkWidget *button = gtk_button_new_with_label ("Save");
        gtk_window_set_child (GTK_WINDOW (window), button);
        gtk_actionable_set_action_name (GTK_ACTIONABLE (button), "win.save");
      }

      // ...

      int
      main (int argc,
            char *argv[])
      {
        GtkApplication *app =
          gtk_application_new ("com.example.App", G_APPLICATION_FLAGS_NONE);
        g_signal_connect (app, "activate", G_CALLBACK (on_app_activate), NULL);
        return g_application_run (G_APPLICATION (app), argc, argv);
      }

   .. code-tab:: python

      from gi.repository import Gio, Gtk


      def on_save_activate(action, _):
          print "You are welcome"


      def on_app_activate(app):
          window = Gtk.ApplicationWindow(application=app)
          window.present()

          action = Gio.SimpleAction(name="save")
          action.connect("activate", on_save_activate)
          window.add_action(action)

          button = Gtk.Button(label="Save")
          window.set_child(button)
          button.set_action_name("win.save")


      app = Gtk.Application()
      app.connect("activate", on_app_activate)
      app.run([])

   .. code-tab:: vala

      public class Example.App : Gtk.Application {
          public App () {
              Object (application_id: "com.example.App",
              flags: ApplicationFlags.FLAGS_NONE);
          }

          public override void activate () {
              var window = new Gtk.ApplicationWindow (this);
              window.present ();

              var action = new SimpleAction ("save", null);
              action.activate.connect (() => {
                  stdout.printf ("You are welcome\n");
              });
              window.add_action (action);

              var button = new Gtk.Button ("Save");
              window.child = button;
              button.action_name = "win.save";
          }

          public static int main (string[] args) {
              var app = new Example.App ();
              return app.run (args);
          }
      }

   .. code-tab:: js

      import Gtk from "gi://Gtk?version=4.0";
      import Adw from "gi://Adw?version=1";
      import Gio from "gi://Gio";

      function on_save_activate(action, param) {
        log("You are welcome");
      }

      function on_app_activate(app) {
        const window = new Gtk.ApplicationWindow({ application });
        window.present();

        const action = new Gio.SimpleAction({ name: "save" });
        action.connect("activate", on_save_activate);
        window.add_action(action);

        const button = new Gtk.Button({ label: "Save" });
        window.set_child(button);
        button.set_action_name("win.save");
      }

      const application = new Gtk.Application();
      application.connect("activate", on_app_activate);
      application.run([]);
```

## Accelerators (keybindings) for actions

Use `gtk_application_add_accelerator()` inside your application's startup
implementation. For example:

```{eval-rst}
.. tabs::

   .. code-tab:: c

      gtk_application_set_accels_for_action (app, "win.new_tab",
                                             (const char *[]) {
                                               "<Control><Shift>T",
                                               NULL,
                                             });

   .. code-tab:: python

      app.set_accels_for_action("win.new_tab", ["<Control><Shift>T"])

   .. code-tab:: vala

      this.set_accels_for_action ("win.new_tab", { "<Control><Shift>T", null });

   .. code-tab:: js

      app.set_accels_for_action("win.new_tab", ["<Control><Shift>T"]);
```

## What can be done with actions

`GActions` that you add to your application or window can be used in
several different ways.

- used with GMenu
- used with GtkActionable widgets
- used with shortcuts
- remotely activated from a remote GApplication instance (only for
  application actions)
- listed as "Additional application actions" in desktop files (only for
  application actions)
- remotely activated from other D-Bus callers (such as Ubuntu's HUD)
- used with GNotification notifications (only for application actions)
