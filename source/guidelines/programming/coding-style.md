# C Coding Style

This document presents the preferred coding style for C programs in GNOME.

While coding style is very much a matter of taste, in GNOME we favor a coding
style that promotes consistency, readability, and maintainability.

We present examples of good coding style as well as examples of bad style that
is not acceptable in GNOME. Please try to submit patches that conform to GNOME’s
coding style; this indicates that you have done your homework to respect the
project’s goal of long-term maintainability. Patches with GNOME’s coding style
will also be easier to review!

:::{important}
This document is intended for C code. Unlike C, other programming languages
have their own official coding style recommendations; we encourage you to
follow them wherever applicable.
:::

These guidelines are heavily inspired by the GTK coding style document; the
Linux kernel coding style; and the GNU coding standards. These are slight
variations of each other, with particular modifications for each project’s
particular needs and culture, and GNOME’s version is no different.

## The single most important rule

The single most important rule when writing code is this: **check the surrounding
code and try to imitate it**.

As a maintainer it is dismaying to receive a patch that is obviously in a
different coding style to the surrounding code. This is disrespectful, like
someone tromping into a spotlessly-clean house with muddy shoes.

So, whatever this document recommends, if there is already written code and you
are contributing to it, keep its current style consistent even if it is not your
favorite style.

Most importantly, do not make your first contribution to a project a change in
the coding style to suit your taste. That is *incredibly* disrespectful.

## Line width

Try to use lines of code between 80 and 120 characters long. This amount of text
is easy to fit in most monitors with a decent font size. Lines longer than that
become hard to read, and they mean that you should probably restructure your
code. If you have too many levels of indentation, it means that you should fix
your code anyway.

## Indentation

In general there are two preferred indentation styles for code in GNOME:

1. Linux Kernel style. Tabs with a length of 8 characters are used for the
   indentation, with K&R brace placement:

```c
for (i = 0; i < num_elements; i++) {
        foo[i] = foo[i] + 42;

        if (foo[i] < 35) {
                printf ("Foo!");
                foo[i]--;
        } else {
                printf ("Bar!");
                foo[i]++;
        }
}
```

2. GNU style. Each new level is indented by 2 spaces, braces go on a line by
   themselves, and they are indented as well:

```c
for (i = 0; i < num_elements; i++)
  {
    foo[i] = foo[i] + 42;

    if (foo[i] < 35)
      {
        printf ("Foo!");
        foo[i]--;
      }
    else
      {
        printf ("Bar!");
        foo[i]++;
      }
  }
```

Both styles have their pros and cons. The most important things is to *be
consistent with the surrounding code*. For example, the GTK library, which is
GNOME’s widget toolkit, is written with the GNU style. Nautilus, GNOME’s file
manager, is written in Linux kernel style. Both styles are perfectly readable
and consistent when you get used to them.

Your first feeling when having to study or work on a piece of code that doesn’t
have your preferred indentation style may be, how shall we put it,
gut-wrenching. You should resist your inclination to reindent everything, or to
use an inconsistent style for your patch. Remember the first rule: be consistent
and respectful of that code’s customs, and your patches will have a much higher
chance of being accepted without a lot of arguing about the right indentation
style.

### Tab characters

*Do not ever change the size of tabs in your editor*; leave them as 8 spaces.
Changing the size of tabs means that code that you didn’t write yourself will be
perpetually misaligned.

Instead, set the indentation size as appropriate for the code you are editing.
When writing in something other than Linux kernel style, you may even want to
tell your editor to automatically convert all tabs to 8 spaces, so that there is
no ambiguity about the intended amount of space.

## Braces

Curly braces should not be used for single statement blocks:

```c
/* valid */
if (condition)
        single_statement ();
else
        another_single_statement (arg1);
```

The “no block for single statements” rule has only four exceptions:

1. In GNU style, if either side of an `if`…`else` statement has braces, both
   sides should, to match up indentation:

```c
/* valid */
if (condition)
  {
    foo ();
    bar ();
  }
else
  {
    baz ();
  }
```

2. If the single statement covers multiple lines, e.g. for functions with many
   arguments, and it is followed by `else` or `else if`:

```c
/* valid Linux kernel style */
if (condition) {
        a_single_statement_with_many_arguments (some_lengthy_argument,
                                                another_lengthy_argument,
                                                and_another_one,
                                                plus_one);
} else
        another_single_statement (arg1, arg2);

/* valid GNU style */
if (condition)
  {
    a_single_statement_with_many_arguments (some_lengthy_argument,
                                            another_lengthy_argument,
                                            and_another_one,
                                            plus_one);
  }
else
  {
    another_single_statement (arg1, arg2);
  }
```

3. If the condition is composed of many lines:

```c
/* valid Linux kernel style */
if (condition1 ||
    (condition2 && condition3) ||
    condition4 ||
    (condition5 && (condition6 || condition7))) {
        a_single_statement ();
}

/* valid GNU style */
if (condition1 ||
    (condition2 && condition3) ||
    condition4 ||
    (condition5 && (condition6 || condition7)))
  {
    a_single_statement ();
  }
```

:::{note}
Such long conditions are usually hard to understand. A good practice is to
set the condition to a boolean variable, with a good name for that variable.
Another way is to move the long condition to a function.
:::

4. Nested `if`, in which case the block should be placed on the outermost `if`:

```c
/* valid Linux kernel style */
if (condition) {
        if (another_condition)
                single_statement ();
        else
                another_single_statement ();
}

/* valid GNU style */
if (condition)
  {
    if (another_condition)
      single_statement ();
    else
      another_single_statement ();
  }
```

In general, new blocks should be placed on a new indentation level, like this:

```c
int retval = 0;

statement_1 ();
statement_2 ();

{
        int var1 = 42;
        gboolean res = FALSE;

        res = statement_3 (var1);

        retval = res ? -1 : 1;
}
```

While curly braces for function definitions should rest on a new line they
should not add an indentation level:

```c
/* valid Linux kernel style*/
static void
my_function (int argument)
{
        do_my_things ();
}

/* valid GNU style*/
static void
my_function (int argument)
{
  do_my_things ();
}
```

## Conditions

Do not check boolean values for equality. By using implicit comparisons, the
resulting code can be read more like conversational English. Another rationale
is that a ‘true’ value may not be necessarily equal to whatever the `TRUE`
macro uses. For example:

```c
if (found)
  do_foo ();

if (!found)
  do_bar ();
```

The C language uses the value `0` for many purposes. As a numeric value, the
end of a string, a null pointer and the `FALSE` boolean. To make the code
clearer, you should write code that highlights the specific way `0` is used.
So when reading a comparison, it is possible to know the variable type. For
boolean variables, an implicit comparison is appropriate because it’s already a
logical expression. Other variable types are not logical expressions by
themselves, so an explicit comparison is better:

```c
if (some_pointer == NULL)
        do_blah ();

if (number == 0)
        do_foo ();

if (str != NULL && *str != '\0')
        do_bar ();
```

## Functions

Functions should be declared by placing the returned value on a separate line from the function name:

```c
void
my_function (void)
{
        // ...
}
```

The argument list must be broken into a new line for each argument, with the
argument names right aligned, taking into account pointers:

```c
void
my_function (some_type_t      type,
             another_type_t  *a_pointer,
             double_ptr_t   **double_pointer,
             final_type_t     another_type)
{
        // ...
}
```

:::{tip}
If you use Emacs, you can use `M-x align` to do this kind of alignment
automatically. Just put the point and mark around the function’s prototype,
and invoke that command.
:::

The alignment also holds when invoking a function without breaking the line
length limit:

```c
align_function_arguments (first_argument,
                          second_argument,
                          third_argument);
```

## Whitespace

Always put a space before an opening parenthesis but never after:

```c
if (condition)
        do_my_things ();

switch (condition) {
}
```

When declaring a structure type use newlines to separate logical sections of the
structure:

```c
struct _GtkWrapBoxPrivate
{
  GtkOrientation orientation;
  GtkWrapAllocationMode mode;

  GtkWrapBoxSpreading horizontal_spreading;
  GtkWrapBoxSpreading vertical_spreading;

  guint16 spacing[2];

  guint16 minimum_line_children;
  guint16 natural_line_children;

  GList *children;
};
```

Do **not** eliminate whitespace and newlines just because something would fit on
a single line:

```c
/* invalid */
if (condition) foo (); else bar ();
```

Do eliminate trailing whitespace on any line, preferably as a separate patch or
commit. Never use empty lines at the beginning or at the end of a file.

## The `switch` statement

A `switch` should open a block on a new indentation level, and each case
should start on the same indentation level as the curly braces, with the case
block on a new indentation level:

```c
/* valid Linux kernel style */
switch (condition) {
case FOO:
        do_foo ();
        break;

case BAR:
        do_bar ();
        break;
}

/* valid GNU style */
switch (condition)
  {
  case FOO:
    do_foo ();
    break;

  case BAR:
    do_bar ();
    break;

  default:
    do_default ();
  }
```

:::{tip}
It is preferable, though not mandatory, to separate the various cases with a
newline.
:::

:::{tip}
The `break` statement for the `default` case is not mandatory.
:::

If switching over an enumerated type, a `case` statement must exist for every
member of the enumerated type. For members you do not want to handle, alias
their case statements to `default`:

```c
switch (enumerated_condition) {
case HANDLED_1:
        do_foo ();
        break;

case HANDLED_2:
        do_bar ();
        break;

case IGNORED_1:
case IGNORED_2:
default:
        do_default ();
}
```

:::{tip}
If most members of the enumerated type should not be handled, consider using an
`if` ... `else if` statement instead of a `switch`.
:::

If a `case` block needs to declare new variables, the same rules as the inner
blocks apply (see above); the `break` statement should be placed outside of
the inner block:

```c
switch (condition)
  {
  case FOO:
    {
      int foo;

      foo = do_foo ();
    }
    break;

  // ...
  }
```

## Header files

The only major rule for headers is that the function definitions should be
vertically aligned in three columns:

```c
return_type          function_name           (type   argument,
                                              type   argument,
                                              type   argument);
```

The maximum width of each column is given by the longest element in the column:

```c
void        gtk_type_set_property (GtkType     *type,
                                   const char  *value,
                                   GError     **error);
const char *gtk_type_get_property (GtkType     *type);
```

It is also possible to align the columns to the next tab, to avoid having to
reformat headers every time you add a new function:

```c
void          gtk_type_set_prop           (GtkType *type,
                                           float    value);
float         gtk_type_get_prop           (GtkType *type);
int           gtk_type_update_foobar      (GtkType *type);
```

If you are creating a public library, try to export a single public header file
that in turn includes all the smaller header files into it. This is so that
public headers are never included directly; rather a single include is used in
applications. For example, GTK uses the following in its header files that
should not be included directly by applications:

```c
// The __GTK_H_INSIDE__ symbol is defined in the gtk.h header
// The GTK_COMPILATION symbol is defined only when compiling
// GTK itself
#if !defined (__GTK_H_INSIDE__) && !defined (GTK_COMPILATION)
#error "Only <gtk/gtk.h> can be included directly."
#endif
```

For libraries, all headers should have inclusion guards (for internal usage) and
C++ guards. These provide the extern "C" magic that C++ requires to include
plain C headers:

```c
#pragma once

#include <gtk/gtk.h>

G_BEGIN_DECLS

// ...

G_END_DECLS
```

:::{tip}
Instead of the `once` pragma you can use an explicit symbol-based
inclusion guard: `#ifndef FILE_H #define FILE_H ... #endif`.
:::

## GObject classes

GObject class definitions and implementations require some additional coding
style notices, and should always be correctly namespaced.

Type declarations should be placed at the beginning of the file:

```c
typedef struct _GtkBoxedStruct       GtkBoxedStruct;
typedef struct _GtkMoreBoxedStruct   GtkMoreBoxedStruct;
```

This includes enumeration types:

```c
typedef enum
{
  GTK_SIZE_REQUEST_WIDTH_FOR_HEIGHT,
  GTK_SIZE_REQUEST_HEIGHT_FOR_WIDTH
} GtkSizeRequestMode;
```

And callback types:

```c
typedef void (* GtkCallback) (GtkWidget *widget,
                              gpointer   user_data);
```

Instance structures should be declared using the `G_DECLARE_FINAL_TYPE()` or
`G_DECLARE_DERIVABLE_TYPE()` macros:

```c
#define GTK_TYPE_FOO (gtk_foo_get_type ())
G_DECLARE_FINAL_TYPE (GtkFoo, gtk_foo, GTK, FOO, GtkWidget)
```

For final types, private data can be stored in the object struct, which should
be defined in the C file:

```c
struct _GtkFoo
{
  GObject   parent_instance;

  guint     private_data;
  gpointer  more_private_data;
};
```

For derivable types, private data must be stored in a private struct in the C
file, configured using `G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_PRIVATE()` and accessed using the
generated `_get_instance_private()` function:

```c
#define GTK_TYPE_FOO gtk_foo_get_type()
G_DECLARE_DERIVABLE_TYPE (GtkFoo, gtk_foo, GTK, FOO, GtkWidget)

struct _GtkFooClass
{
  GtkWidgetClass parent_class;

  void (* handle_frob)  (GtkFrobber *frobber,
                         guint       n_frobs);

  // Padding, for ABI compatible expansion of the class
  gpointer padding[12];
};
```

Always use the `G_DEFINE_TYPE()`, `G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_PRIVATE()`, and
`G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_CODE()` macros, or their abstract variants
`G_DEFINE_ABSTRACT_TYPE()`, `G_DEFINE_ABSTRACT_TYPE_WITH_PRIVATE()`, and
`G_DEFINE_ABSTRACT_TYPE_WITH_CODE()`; also, use the similar macros for
defining interfaces and boxed types.

Interfaces should be declared using the `G_DECLARE_INTERFACE()` macro:

```c
#define GTK_TYPE_FOOABLE gtk_fooable_get_type()
G_DECLARE_INTERFACE (GtkFooable, gtk_fooable, GTK, FOOABLE, GObject)
```

## Memory allocation

When dynamically allocating data on the heap use `g_new()`.

Public structure types should always be returned after being zero-ed, either
explicitly for each member, or by using `g_new0()`.

## Macros

Try to avoid private macros unless strictly necessary. Remember to `#undef`
them at the end of a block or a series of functions needing them.

Inline functions are usually preferable to private macros.

Public macros should not be used unless they evaluate to a constant.

## Public API

Avoid exporting variables as public API, since this is cumbersome on some
platforms. It is always preferable to add getters and setters instead. Also,
beware global variables in general.

To avoid exposing private API in the shared library, it is recommended to
default to a `hidden` symbol visibility, and explicitly annotate public
symbols in the header file.

Non-exported functions that are only needed in one source file should be
declared `static` to that file.
