# Managing Memory

The GNOME stack is predominantly written in C, so dynamically allocated memory
has to be managed manually. Through use of GLib convenience APIs, memory
management can be trivial, but programmers always need to keep memory in mind
when writing code.

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the idea of heap allocation of
memory using `malloc()` and `free()`, and knows of the paired GLib
equivalents, `g_malloc()` and `g_free()`.

## Principles of memory management

The normal approach to memory management is for the programmer to keep track of
which variables point to allocated memory, and to manually free them when they
are no longer needed. This is correct, but can be clarified by introducing the
concept of ownership, which is the piece of code (such as a function, struct or
object) which is responsible for freeing a piece of allocated memory (an
allocation). Each allocation has exactly one owner; this owner may change as the
program runs, by transferring ownership to another piece of code. Each variable
is owned or unowned, according to whether the scope containing it is always its
owner. Each function parameter and return type either transfers ownership of the
values passed to it, or it doesn’t. If code which owns some memory doesn’t
deallocate that memory, that’s a memory leak. If code which doesn’t own some
memory frees it, that’s a double-free. Both are bad.

By statically calculating which variables are owned, memory management becomes a
simple task of unconditionally freeing the owned variables before they leave
their scope, and not freeing the unowned variables. The key question to answer
for all memory is: which code has ownership of this memory?

There is an important restriction here: variables must never change from owned
to unowned (or vice-versa) at runtime. This restriction is key to simplifying
memory management.

For example, consider the functions:

```c
char *  generate_string (const char *template);

void    print_string    (const char *str);
```

The following code has been annotated to note where the ownership transfers
happen:

```c
char *my_str = NULL;  /* owned */
const char *template;  /* unowned */
GValue value = G_VALUE_INIT;  /* owned */
g_value_init (&value, G_TYPE_STRING);

/* Transfers ownership of a string from the function to the variable. */
template = "XXXXXX";
my_str = generate_string (template);

/* No ownership transfer. */
print_string (my_str);

/* Transfer ownership. We no longer have to free @my_str. */
g_value_take_string (&value, my_str);

/* We still have ownership of @value, so free it before it goes out of scope. */
g_value_unset (&value);
```

There are a few points here: Firstly, the ‘owned’ comments by the variable
declarations denote that those variables are owned by the local scope, and hence
need to be freed before they go out of scope. The alternative is ‘unowned’,
which means the local scope does not have ownership, and must not free the
variables before going out of scope. Similarly, ownership must not be
transferred to them on assignment.

Secondly, the variable type modifiers reflect whether they transfer ownership:
because `my_str` is owned by the local scope, it has type `char*`, whereas
`template` is `const` to denote it is unowned. Similarly, the `template`
parameter of `generate_string()` and the `str` parameter of
`print_string()` are marked as `const` because no ownership is transferred
when those functions are called. As ownership is transferred for the string
parameter of `g_value_take_string()`, we can expect its type to be gchar.

(Note that this is not the case for GObject instances and subclasses, which can
never be `const`. It is only the case for strings and simple structs.)

Finally, a few libraries use a function naming convention to indicate ownership
transfer, for example using ‘take’ in a function name to indicate full transfer
of parameters, as with `g_value_take_string()`.

Note that different libraries use different conventions, as shown below:

```{eval-rst}
.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 25 25 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Function name
     - Convention 1 (standard)
     - Convention 2 (alternate)
     - Convention 3 (``gdbus-codegen``)
   * - ``get``
     - transfer: none
     - any transfer
     - transfer: full
   * - ``dup``
     - transfer: full
     - unused
     - unused
   * - ``peek``
     - unused
     - unused
     - transfer: none
   * - ``set``
     - transfer: none
     - transfer: none
     - transfer: none
   * - ``take``
     - transfer: full
     - unused
     - unused
   * - ``steal``
     - transfer: full
     - transfer: full
     - transfer: full

```

Ideally, all functions have a `(transfer)` introspection annotation for all
relevant parameters and the return value. Failing that, here is a set of
guidelines to use to determine whether ownership of a return value is
transferred:

1. If the type has an introspection `(transfer)` annotation, look at that.
2. Otherwise, if the type is const, there is no transfer.
3. Otherwise, if the function documentation explicitly specifies the return
   value must be freed, there is full or container transfer.
4. Otherwise, if the function is named ‘dup’, ‘take’ or ‘steal’, there is full
   or container transfer.
5. Otherwise, if the function is named ‘peek’, there is no transfer.
6. Otherwise, you need to look at the function’s code to determine whether it
   intends ownership to be transferred. Then file a bug against the
   documentation for that function, and ask for an introspection annotation
   to be added.

Given this ownership and transfer infrastructure, the correct approach to memory
allocation can be mechanically determined for each situation. In each case, the
`copy()` function must be appropriate to the data type, for example
`g_strdup()` for strings, or `g_object_ref()` for GObjects.

When thinking about ownership transfer, `malloc()`/`free()` and reference
counting are equivalent: in the former case, a newly allocated piece of heap
memory is transferred; in the latter, a newly incremented reference.

## Documentation

Documenting the ownership transfer for each function parameter and return, and
the ownership for each variable, is important. While they may be clear when
writing the code, they are not clear a few months later; and may never be clear
to users of an API. They should always be documented.

The best way to document ownership transfer is to use the `(transfer)`
annotation introduced by [gobject-introspection]. Include this in the API
documentation comment for each function parameter and return type. By doing so,
the introspection tools can also read the annotations and use them to correctly
introspect the API.

:::{tip}
If a function is not public API, write a documentation comment for it anyway
and include the `(transfer)` annotations. This will help you and other
people working on your code.
:::

For example:

```c
/**
 * g_value_take_string:
 * @value: (transfer none): an initialized #GValue
 * @str: (transfer full): string to set it to
 *
 * Function documentation goes here.
 */

/**
 * generate_string:
 * @template: (transfer none): a template to follow when generating the string
 *
 * Function documentation goes here.
 *
 * Returns: (transfer full): a newly generated string
 */
```

Ownership for variables can be documented using inline comments. These are
non-standard, and not read by any tools, but can form a convention if used
consistently:

```c
GObject *some_owned_object = NULL;  /* owned */
GObject *some_unowned_object;  /* unowned */
```

The documentation for container types is similarly only a convention; it
includes the type of the contained elements too:

```c
/* PtrArray<owned char*> */
GPtrArray *some_unowned_string_array;  /* unowned */

/* PtrArray<owned char*> */
GPtrArray *some_owned_string_array = NULL;  /* owned */

/* PtrArray<owned GObject*> */
GPtrArray *some_owned_object_array = NULL;  /* owned */
```

Note also that owned variables should always be initialized so that freeing them is more convenient.

:::{note}
Some types, for example basic C types like strings, can have the `const`
modifier added if they are unowned, to take advantage of compiler warnings
resulting from assigning those variables to owned variables (which must
**not** use the `const` modifier). If so, the `/* unowned */` comment may
be omitted.
:::

## Reference counting

As well as conventional `malloc()`/`free()`-style types, GLib has various
reference counted types — GObject being a prime example.

The concepts of ownership and transfer apply just as well to reference counted
types as they do to allocated types. A scope owns a reference counted type if it
holds a strong reference to the instance (for example by calling
`g_object_ref()`). An instance can be ‘copied’ by calling `g_object_ref()`
again.  Ownership can be released with `g_object_unref()` — even though this
may not actually finalize the instance, it frees the current scope’s ownership
of that instance.

:::{tip}
See `g_clear_object()` for a convenient way of handling GObject references.
:::

There are other reference counted types in GLib, such as `GHashTable` (using
`g_hash_table_ref()` and `g_hash_table_unref()`), or `GVariant`
(`g_variant_ref()`, `g_variant_unref()`). For historical reasons, some
types, like `GHashTable`, support both reference counting and explicit
finalization. Reference counting should always be used in preference, because it
allows instances to be easily shared between multiple scopes (each holding their
own reference) without having to allocate multiple copies of the instance. This
saves memory.

:::{tip}
GLib [provides API](https://docs.gtk.org/glib/reference-counting.html)
for easily implementing reference counted types, in the form of
`g_rc_box_new()` and `g_atomic_rc_box_new()`.
:::

### Floating references

Classes which are derived from `GInitiallyUnowned`, as opposed to GObject,
have an initial reference which is *floating*, meaning that no code owns the
reference. As soon as `g_object_ref_sink()` is called on the object, the
floating reference is converted to a strong reference, and the calling code
assumes ownership of the object.

Floating references are a convenience for use in C in APIs, such as GTK, where
large numbers of objects must be created and organized into a hierarchy. In
these cases, calling `g_object_unref()` to drop all the strong references would
result in a lot of code:

```
// Without floating references
GtkWidget *new_widget;

new_widget = gtk_some_widget_new ();
gtk_container_add (some_container, new_widget);
g_object_unref (new_widget);

// With floating references
gtk_container_add (some_container, gtk_some_widget_new ());
```

:::{note}
Note that g_object_ref_sink() is equivalent to g_object_ref() when called on
a non-floating reference, making gtk_container_add() no different from any
other function in such cases.
:::

Floating references are only used by a few APIs — in particular, `GtkWidget`
and all its subclasses, or `GVariant`. You must learn which APIs support it,
and which APIs consume floating references, and only use them together.

:::{important}
When designing the API of newer libraries you should **not** use floating
references, as they require special handling inside language bindings.
:::

Floating references can be effectively replaced by having your
`container_add()` function transfer the ownership of the object you are
adding, and annotating the argument using `(transfer full)`:

```c
/**
 * your_container_add:
 * @container: a container object
 * @element: (transfer full): the element to add
 *
 * Adds a new element to a container.
 */
 void
 your_container_add (YourContainer *container,
                     YourElement   *element)
 {
   g_ptr_array_add (container->elements, element);
 }
```

## Convenience functions

GLib provides various convenience functions for memory management, especially
for GObjects. Three will be covered here, but others exist — check the GLib API
documentation for more. They typically follow similar naming schemas to these
three (using ‘\_full’ suffixes, or the verb ‘clear’ in the function name).

### `g_clear_pointer()`

`g_clear_pointer()` is a function which frees the contents of a pointer, using
the given `GDestroyNotify` function, and then clears the pointer by setting it
to `NULL`.

:::{tip}
The C standard guarantees that `free()` is always `NULL`-safe, and so
does GLib for `g_free()`. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee made for any
other free function to be `NULL`-safe, so it's recommended to use
`g_clear_pointer()` to avoid use-after-free issues.
:::

### `g_clear_object()`

`g_clear_object()` is a version of `g_object_unref()` which unrefs a GObject
and then clears the pointer to it to `NULL`.

This makes it easier to implement code that guarantees a GObject pointer is
always either `NULL`, or has ownership of a GObject (but which never points to
a GObject it no longer owns).

By initialising all owned GObject pointers to `NULL`, freeing them at the end
of the scope is as simple as calling `g_clear_object()` without any checks:

```c
void
my_function (void)
{
  GObject *some_object = NULL;  /* owned */

  if (rand ())
    {
      some_object = create_new_object ();
      /* do something with the object */
    }

  g_clear_object (&some_object);
}
```

### `g_list_free_full()` and `g_slist_free_full()`

`g_list_free_full()` and `g_slist_free_full()` free all the elements in a
linked list, and all their data. It is much more convenient than iterating
through the list to free all the elements’ data, then calling `g_list_free()`,
or `g_slist_free()` to free the list elements themselves.

### `g_hash_table_new_full()`

`g_hash_table_new_full()` is a version of `g_hash_table_new()` which allows
setting functions to destroy each key and value in the hash table when they are
removed. These functions are then automatically called for all keys and values
when the hash table is destroyed, or when an entry is removed using
`g_hash_table_remove()`.

Essentially, it simplifies memory management of keys and values to the question
of whether they are present in the hash table.

Similar functions exist for `GPtrArray` and `GArray`:

- `g_ptr_array_new_with_free_func()`
- `g_array_set_clear_func()`

## Container types

When using container types, such as `GPtrArray` or `GList`, an additional
level of ownership is introduced: as well as the ownership of the container
instance, each element in the container is either owned or unowned too. By
nesting containers, multiple levels of ownership must be tracked. Ownership of
owned elements belongs to the container; ownership of the container belongs to
the scope it’s in (which may be another container).

A key principle for simplifying this is to ensure that all elements in a
container have the same ownership: they are either all owned, or all unowned.
This happens automatically if the normal convenience functions are used for
types like `GPtrArray` and `GHashTable`.

If elements in a container are owned, adding them to the container is
essentially an ownership transfer. For example, for an array of strings, if the
elements are owned, the definition of `g_ptr_array_add()` is effectively:

```c
/**
 * g_ptr_array_add:
 * @array: a #GPtrArray
 * @str: (transfer full): string to add
 */
void
g_ptr_array_add (GPtrArray *array,
                 gchar     *str);
```

So, for example, constant (unowned) strings must be added to the array using
`g_ptr_array_add (array, g_strdup ("constant string"))`.

Whereas if the elements are unowned, the definition is effectively:

```c
/**
 * g_ptr_array_add:
 * @array: a #GPtrArray
 * @str: (transfer none): string to add
 */
void
g_ptr_array_add (GPtrArray   *array,
                 const gchar *str);
```

Here, constant strings can be added without copying them: `g_ptr_array_add (array, "constant string")`.

## Single-path cleanup

A useful design pattern for more complex functions is to have a single control
path which cleans up (frees) allocations and returns to the caller. This vastly
simplifies tracking of allocations, as it’s no longer necessary to mentally work
out which allocations have been freed on each code path — all code paths end at
the same point, so perform all the frees then. The benefits of this approach
rapidly become greater for larger functions with more owned local variables; it
may not make sense to apply the pattern to smaller functions.

This approach has two requirements:

1. The function returns from a single point, and uses `goto` to reach that
   point from other paths.
2. All owned variables are set to `NULL` when initialized or when ownership
   is transferred away from them.

The example below is for a small function (for brevity), but should illustrate
the principles for application of the pattern to larger functions:

```c
GObject *
some_function (GError **error)
{
  char *some_str = NULL;  /* owned */
  GObject *temp_object = NULL;  /* owned */
  const char *temp_str;
  GObject *my_object = NULL;  /* owned */
  GError *child_error = NULL;  /* owned */

  temp_object = generate_object ();
  temp_str = "example string";

  if (rand ())
    {
      some_str = g_strconcat (temp_str, temp_str, NULL);
    }
  else
    {
      some_operation_which_might_fail (&child_error);

      if (child_error != NULL)
        goto done;

      my_object = generate_wrapped_object (temp_object);
    }

done:
  /* Here, @some_str is either NULL or a string to be freed, so can be passed to
   * g_free() unconditionally.
   *
   * Similarly, @temp_object is either NULL or an object to be unreffed, so can
   * be passed to g_clear_object() unconditionally.
   */
  g_free (some_str);
  g_clear_object (&temp_object);

  /* The pattern can also be used to ensure that the function always returns
   * either an error or a return value (but never both).
   */
  if (child_error != NULL)
    {
      g_propagate_error (error, child_error);
      g_clear_object (&my_object);
    }

  return my_object;
}
```

:::{tip}
If you are writing code that targets GCC or other GCC-compatible compilers
and will not be ported to other platforms, you can avoid the use of `goto`
by using the `g_autoptr` macro that GLib [provides](https://developer-old.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Miscellaneous-Macros.html#g-autoptr).
:::

## Verification

Memory leaks can be checked for in two ways: static analysis, and runtime leak
checking.

Static analysis with tools like Coverity, the Clang static analyzer or [Tartan](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/tartan/tartan) can catch some leaks, but
require knowledge of the ownership transfer of every function called in the
code. Domain-specific static analyzers like Tartan (which knows about GLib
memory allocation and transfer) can perform better here, but Tartan is quite a
young project and still misses things (a low true positive rate). It is
recommended that code be put through a static analyzer, but the primary tool for
detecting leaks should be runtime leak checking.

Runtime leak checking is done using Valgrind, using its memcheck tool. Any leak
it detects as ‘definitely losing memory’ should be fixed. Many of the leaks
which ‘potentially’ lose memory are not real leaks, and should be added to the
suppression file.

If compiling with a recent version of Clang or GCC, the address sanitizer can be
enabled instead, and it will detect memory leaks and overflow problems at
runtime, but without the difficulty of running Valgrind in the right
environment. Note, however, that it is still a young tool, so may fail in some
cases.
