  best practices for memory management, namespacing, GObject Introspection,
  and more.
- {doc}`Accessibility <guidelines/accessibility>`: guidelines on creating
  accessible apps and software.
- {doc}`Localization <guidelines/localization>`: standard practices for making
  software that can be used across languages and locales.

  module maintainers.

The GNOME Human Interface Guidelines can be found in [their own website](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/).
:::

Many of these guidelines are most applicable to developers who are contributing
to the GNOME project, and will help them to write code which is legible and
maintainable over a long period of time by a diverse team of contributors.
However, some of the guidelines have more general relevance and are useful to
those who are using the GNOME platform to create software of their own.
