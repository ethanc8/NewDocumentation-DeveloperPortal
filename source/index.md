# GNOME Developer Documentation

Welcome to the GNOME platform! This documentation provides essential information and resources for those developing software with and for the GNOME platform. It is also a portal to other sources of GNOME developer documentation that are available elsewhere.

## Content overview

The documentation on this site is organized into three main sections:

- {doc}`Platform introduction <introduction>`: an introduction to the GNOME platform. This describes the main platform components, development tools and programming languages that can be used.
- {doc}`Guidelines <guidelines>`: detailed development information, including programming and integration guidelines.
- {doc}`Tooling <tools>`: useful tools for newcomer and experienced developers
- {doc}`Tutorials <tutorials>`: shorter pages on common topics, with step-by-step instructions.
- {doc}`Specifications <specifications>`: formal description of formats, IPC interfaces, and other interoperable parts of the GNOME platform

## Additional resources

Additional external development resources for the GNOME platform include:

- [GNOME Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/): user experience design guidelines
- [Discussion forums](https://discourse.gnome.org/): a great place to ask for help and advice
