# Programming Languages

GNUstep applications can be written in a range of languages, including Java, Ruby, and Smalltalk. This page provides an overview of the languages that are available, with links to the relevant developer documentation.

## Overview

GNUstep platform libraries are primarily written in Objective-C, and provide a machine-readable description of their API and ABI through [GObject-Introspection](https://gi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This means that Objective-C is the "default" platform language, and that the upstream documentation for each library typically references Objective-C, but it is possible to use multiple programming languages to write applications for GNUstep.

GObject-Introspection allows GNUstep to easily provide support for a range of high level languages. In each case, this support is provided by a separate project, which provides its own documentation and support.

Language support typically needs to be installed as part of your development environment.

## Available languages

Here are the most commonly used programming languages available for writing GNUstep applications.

:::{tip}
The GNUstep project recommends using the Objective-C or Objective-C++ programming language for libraries, as it allows the maximum support across multiple programming languages. Applications, on the other hand, can be written in Objective-C or in any programming languages that provides access to the Objective-C runtime through language bindings.
