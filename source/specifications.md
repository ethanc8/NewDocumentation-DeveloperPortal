# Specifications

The GNOME platform depends on various specifications to allow interoperability
between applications, platforms, and environments:

- [Autostart](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/autostart-spec/)
- [Base directories](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/basedir-spec/)
- [Desktop entries](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/desktop-entry-spec/)
- [Icon themes](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/icon-theme-spec/)
- [Shared MIME database](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/shared-mime-info-spec/)
- [Trash storage](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/trash-spec/)

For more information, see the [freedesktop.org project](https://freedesktop.org).

Additionally, GNOME depends on file formats and IPC interfaces that are
available for the purpose of interoperability:
